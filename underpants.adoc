As it stands the SEMS/Sepheo concept is a bit like South Park's
"Underpants Gnomes" plan for success:

1. Collect underpants
2. ...
3. Profit!

Or in our case:

1. Collect freelancer contacts
2. ...
3. Profit!

We need to flesh out step 2. What is it which actually adds value?

An idea: be a platform for matchmaking, and reward the matchmakers

1. Collect freelancer and client contacts, wants and offers
2.1. Society selects N people for matchmaker role
2.2. provide them access to the directory of freelancers and clients needs/wants
2.3. Matchmakers respond to clients (freelancers?) expressing needs, sign agreement to find
2.4. Fee paid for successful matches, split between matchmaker and society 
3. Profit!

Matchmakers nominated by society and and work in the society/client interests

Terms of this arrangement managed by stewards, who are nominated by
the society to look after the organisation's interests - but are not matchmakers.
Stewards' work is funded by membership fee.
