As it stands the SEMS/Sepheo concept is a bit like South Park's
"Underpants Gnomes" plan for success:

1. Collect underpants
2. ...
3. Profit!

Or in our case:

1. Collect freelancer contacts
2. ...
3. Profit!

We need to flesh out step 2. What is it which actually adds value?

An idea: be a platform for matchmaking, and reward the matchmakers

. Collect freelancer and client contacts, wants and offers
. Next...
.. Society selects N people for matchmaker role
.. provide them access to the directory of freelancers and clients needs/wants
.. Matchmakers respond to clients (freelancers?) expressing needs, sign agreement to find
.. Fee paid for successful matches, split between matchmaker and society 
. Profit!

Matchmakers nominated by society and and work in the society/client interests

Terms of this arrangement managed by stewards, who are nominated by
the society to look after the organisation's interests - but are not matchmakers.
Stewards' work is funded by membership fee.
