# Jobs To Be Done
These notes are a translation and adaptation using chat GPT based on my notes from a course on JTBD approach from around 2019

## 1. Hypothesis Testing Approach

From “ideas in your head” to testing those ideas (hypotheses).
Instead of trying to figure out in advance “what customers need,” focus on verifying whether the solution you have in mind actually resonates with them.
In other words, don’t ask customers what they want; test whether they truly need what you’ve already hypothesized.
## 2. The Riskiest Assumption Test

Identify the assumptions that, if proven false, would invalidate the entire product or business idea. Examples:
- Is there a viable market or segment for this?
- Will people actually purchase it?
- Is it feasible to produce and sell at a profit?
Test these assumptions early with quick, low-cost experiments. By doing so, you ensure you don’t waste resources on a product that ultimately fails once it hits the market.

Keywords: market → segment → purchase → convergence.
"Convergence" here can mean the point at which your hypothesis, target audience, and product offering align in a way that makes the business viable.
## 3. Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)

The JTBD framework helps you understand why people “hire” a product or service. It breaks down tasks or “jobs” at different levels:

### 3.1 Big Job
Definition: The overarching goal or main outcome a person seeks.

Examples:
- “Make a great impression,”
- “Feel more confident at an event or in a social setting,”
- “Flirt successfully or meet someone at a party.”

These are large, emotional, or socially motivated objectives.

### 3.2 Small Job
Definition: Specific tasks that support the “Big Job.”

Examples:
- “Buy my favorite sneakers,”
- “Get popular (trendy) sneakers,”
- “Play my favorite melody,”
- “Play a well-known tune at a gathering (so others recognize it).”
  
These smaller tasks are often stepping stones toward the bigger, more emotional “job.”

3.3 Micro Job
Definition: Routine or maintenance tasks that the user often doesn’t want to do, yet must do in order to meet the overall goal.

Examples:
- “Buy, store, and maintain my sneakers,”
- “Clean them, keep them in good shape,”
- “Purchase new guitar strings, tune the instrument, etc.”
  
Micro jobs are frequently obligatory details that users find tedious but cannot skip if they want to achieve the main outcome.

## 4. Forces Influencing a User’s Decision

When a user contemplates using (or switching to) a new solution, four forces come into play:
1. Push: Problems or dissatisfaction with the current solution.
2. Pull: Hope and desire for a better alternative (the new solution).
3. Habit (the strongest force): Inertia from doing things “the usual way,” which can be difficult to break.
4. Fear of Failure: Worries that the new solution won’t work or might lead to negative consequences.
   
Understanding these forces helps you plan your product strategy and address user concerns during interviews.

## 5. Criteria for Identifying Real Problems

#### Frequency & Importance
- How often does the problem occur (frequency)?
- How big a deal is it when it happens (importance)?
#### Diving Deeper into Emotions
Go beyond surface-level answers and uncover emotional drivers: “Why does it bother you?” “How does it make you feel?”
#### Transparency in Interviews
Let people know you may record the session, ask about emotions, and discuss potentially difficult experiences.
#### When Users Say They Want a Feature
Instead of taking it at face value, ask: “When did you start wanting it?” This moment often reveals the underlying trigger—the real “job” or problem that made them realize they needed something new.
## Adding Some Context: How to Put JTBD into Practice
### Conduct Problem Interviews
Talk to potential users/customers. Focus on times they experienced the problem or tried to achieve the big/small/micro jobs.
Probe for the emotional drivers and triggers (the “push” and “pull” forces).
Map Out Their Current Journey
What are they doing now?
Where do they get stuck?
How often does the problem occur, and why is it important to them?
### Look for Patterns
Do multiple users share the same pain point or motivation?
Are they describing the same Big Job but fulfilling it with different solutions?
### Test the Riskiest Assumptions
If your entire solution hinges on, for example, whether people will pay a premium price for your product, that’s a big, risky assumption—test it directly.
### Iterate
Based on what you learn, refine your understanding of their Big Job.
Adjust your feature set to address the real points of friction.
Repeat interviews with new or returning participants to confirm you’re on track.
## Final Takeaways

### Start with a Hypothesis
Don’t try to guess every need; come up with a hypothesis and then test it rigorously.
### Use the JTBD Lens
Ask what “jobs” your customers are trying to get done—Big, Small, and Micro. Each level reveals different motivations and tasks.
### Manage the Four Forces
To get adoption, address the user’s fear of failure, combat existing habits, highlight the push from existing frustrations, and emphasize the pull of your product’s benefits.
### Always Validate
Test the riskiest assumptions first. Make sure you’re not building a product that is nice in theory but doesn’t solve a frequent or important problem in real life.

By applying these principles, you’ll more effectively identify what truly matters to your users and ensure that your product or solution is something they actually “hire” to get their job done.
