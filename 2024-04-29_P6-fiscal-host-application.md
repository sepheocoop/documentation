"Sepheo" is the working title for a project which aims to become a mutual society for self-employed professionals. We aspire to the Rochdale Co-operative principles, and the Solidarity Economy principles. The working title might stand for "Self employed people helping each other", or it might not.

The problem: whilst employment in a typical company can be alienating for reasons well understood to the co-op movement, co-ops are not widely accessible as alternatives for most people. Their relative rarity, low visibility and familiarity mean they're often not perceived as existing, yet alone as a possible alternative, and even then they may be dismissed as unpractical or just undesirable.  Finally, gaining co-op membership often requires a much higher degree of trust than does employment.

Self-employment is another way to attain more autonomy, and is becoming more common in the contemporary "gig economy" but can be precarious and isolating. It requires various sorts of legal, business, and social expertise outside the core skills of a professional, not to mention the confidence to attain these.

The hope is that a mutual society for self-employed people will help to bridge that gap.
- Support professional networking:
  - Freelancers looking for work and clients
  - Freelancers looking for collaborators
  - Co-ops with a need for temporary labour
  - Co-op wishing to recruit members
- Support the co-operative movement, its principles and professionals' understanding thereof:
  - Practical opportunities to learn about co-op and solidarity culture / processes
  - Formation of autonomous teams of freelancers
  - Co-op formation by members
  - Recruitment of members by co-ops
- Support members' health and welfare through schemes and partnerships for:
  - Connecting members socially as well as professionally
  - Buyers' clubs
  - Mutual insurance
  - Childcare
  - Advice
  - Training
  - Dispute resolution

An outcome we would like is to make co-operatives more visible, and easier to access through the intermediate step of being freelancer working within co-operative contexts. Conversely, for suitable workers to become more visible and easier to access for co-operatives.

The aim is to support this through two revenue streams (possibly more as opportunities arise):
- membership fees
- introduction fees

The organisation will begin as an unincorporated association running with a minimal budget and administration cost, managed by existing freelancers who share this vision. Initially they will canvas freelancers and organisations potentially looking for introductions, collecting statements of interest, whilst researching the amount and number of membership or introduction fees which might be supported.

If this succeeds, and the existence of tens or hundreds of paying members can been identified, it aims to be able to switch to recruiting members and collecting fees. This will support subsequent work of a small team of stewards, who will then start implementing the plan of co-operative governance and helping members whilst gaining further revenue from match-making.

There are four people involved at the moment - all (ex-) members of Code-Operative. This is an older co-operative organisation with a similar aspiration to be a "freelancer network". It has given us very useful experience and insights into the problem space, but so far has remained small, and we believe cannot be easily transformed into the above vision of a mutual society.
