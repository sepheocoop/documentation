"Sepheo" is the working title for a project which aims to become a mutual society for self-employed professionals. We aspire to the Rochdale Co-operative principles, and the Solidarity Economy principles. The working title might stand for "Self employed people helping each other", or it might not!

The problem: whilst employment in a typical company can be alienating for reasons well understood to the co-op movement, co-ops are not a widely accessible alternative for most people. Their relative rarity, low visibility and unfamiliarity mean they're often not perceived as existing, yet alone as a possible alternative - even then they may be dismissed.  In the other direction, co-ops often require a much higher degree of trust to grant membership than they would employment.

Freelancing is another way to attain more autonomy, and is becoming more common in the contemporary "gig economy", but can be precarious and isolating. It requires various legal, business, and social expertises outside the core skills of a professional - not to mention the confidence to attain these.

The hope is that we can help to bridge that gap, making co-operatives more visible, and easier to access through the intermediate step of freelancing within co-operative contexts. Likewise, to make freelancers more visible and easier to access for co-operatives.

Early goals are simply to support:
  - Freelancers looking for work and clients, and collaborators
  - Co-ops with a need for temporary labour or to recruit members
  - Members networking, socially as well as professionally

We aim to provide tools and practical opportunities to help with:
  - Education about co-op and solidarity culture / processes
  - Formation of autonomous teams of freelancers
  - Co-op formation by members
  - Recruitment of members by co-ops

If this works out and we gain sufficient membership/revenue, more ambitious goals might be to form buyers' clubs; mutual insurance schemes; and find partners supplying childcare, advice, training, or dispute resolution.

The organisation will begin unincorporated with a minimal budget, managed by existing freelancers. A potential membership list will be compiled through canvassing freelancers and organisations potentially looking for introductions, in order to research their needs. In this phase we will use Open Collective as a tool for managing expenses, and possibly donations.

The aim is to support this through two revenue streams (possibly more as opportunities arise):
- membership fees
- introduction fees

If sources of revenue seem viable, we will then open a bank account and/or decide whether to incorporate.

The four people involved at the moment are all members of Code-Operative, a Co-Tech member with a similar aspiration to be a freelancer network. It gave us very useful experience and insights into working as freelancers in the co-operative movement, but we now believe it cannot be easily transformed into the above vision, hence this new project.
