# Are you a self-employed freelancer?

## Hello! We are Sepheo.

We are a "mutual society": a member owned and run organisation.

The society exists to support freelancers in the UK, following the
principles of co-operative societies. (One of which is to support
other co-operative organisations.)

 - Our customers are the members.
 - Our members are freelancers.
 - Our members democratically control the society.
 - The society works for the benefit of the members.

To help you remember it, you could think of Sepheo as an acronym for:
"Self-Employed People Helping Each Other"

The initial aim is to provide a skills database and networking
opportunities to members and their potential clients. 

Typically our members are individuals freelancing in the digital
sector. They may be sole-traders, or use a service company as a
vehicle for that. We may request a higher fee if the company is a
multi-person vehicle, i.e. has multiple directors.

As there are legal requirements for agencies, to be clear: We are a
members' organisation, not an agency, nor a profit-seeking
business. We will not be employing freelancers and suppling their
labour to 3rd parties, nor - beyond the initial introduction - acting
as intermediaries between freelancers and clients. Our members will
contract directly with their clients which we help them find (or they
can use an umbrella company if they need to.)

We plan to grow like this:

Phase 1:
 - expand the society's network and membership
Phase 2: 
 - perform outreach
 - raise funds through
   - member subscriptions, and
   - an introduction commission fee for clients who successfully hire them
Phase 3:
 - use the revenue to improve the tools and expand the services

[Repeat these as necessary]

It's very young, so at the time of writing, we are still in phase 1.

Get in touch and help us get to Phase 2 and beyond!

Registering on our skills database is free: you don't even need to be
a member. You'll just need to be a freelancer, and keep your details
and status up to date.

Organisations can also register with us as an affiliate organisation,
if they wish, again this has no charge.

Freelancers can get membership if you contribute Â£5/month or
more. Members get to vote on society decisions, and will get other
benefits, as decided by the members.
